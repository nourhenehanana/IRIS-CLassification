# IRIS-CLassification
Perform data modeling on IRIS data using both supervised and unsupervised learning using Linear Regression, Knearest neighbors (KNN), Tree Decision and Random Forest Classifier then unsupervised learning using KMeans.

1- Perform linear regression on attributes petal length and petal width ( Mean Squarred Error= 0.04 whenever this metric approach 0 means that the predicted values are very close to the actual values , Determination Coefficient 0.92 means that the model is doing an excellent job of capturing and explaining the variation in the data)

2- Perform Kneighbors Classifier (KNN) on attributes sepal length and sepath width with accuracy =0.96 (a new observation is marked in yellow)

3- Perform Tree Decision with accuracy of 0.921

4- Perform Random Forest Classifier 0.973
